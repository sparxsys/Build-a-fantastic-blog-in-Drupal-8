Long back in 2011 I wrote on book in Drupal. My objective was not to write a book to talk about teaching Drupal functionality but more about talking about a specific use case. Many people have asked me that whether we should be using Drupal for building a blog instead of Wordpress. Well the answer is based on my personal bias towards Drupal. Wordpress is definitely a great CMS for building a blog but if you want to build a career in Drupal and want to learn to make bigger and more complex site than first step is to use it for simple sites like a blog.

Now blog itself can be very complicated, there are lot of things in a typical blog that we should be worrying about and managing a live site in Drupal is definitely a good approach to learn Drupal.

I am now updating the partially complete book that I wrote in 2011. In my free time and on weekend my plan is to update the book with the new features of Drupal 8 but my objective for this book would be to end up building a block.

Who should be reading this book?
1. Learning Drupal for the first time
2. Want to evaluate Drupal
