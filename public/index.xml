      <description>Long back in 2011 I wrote on book in Drupal. My objective was not to write a book to talk about teaching Drupal functionality but more about talking about a specific use case. Many people have asked me that whether we should be using Drupal for building a blog instead of Wordpress. Well the answer is based on my personal bias towards Drupal. Wordpress is definitely a great CMS for building a blog but if you want to build a career in Drupal and want to learn to make bigger and more complex site than first step is to use it for simple sites like a blog.</description>
